## Introduction:

Hey, thanks for going to my apartment on such short notice. I really need my wallet. Oh, is the radio still on? Can you please turn it off, I forgot I left it on. Just touching it will turn it off.

## Radio Turned Off

Thanks for turning off the radio, now, I think that the wallet should be in the top drawer of the cabinet, can you get it for me?

## Not in Drawer

Really? I swear I left it in the top one, well, I think it will probably be in one of the other drawers.

## Not in Any Drawer

Maybe it's on the windowsill? I am really not sure where it might be now. Sorry for that.

## Not on windowsill

The last place I can think it might be is in the stand under the TV, can you check that?

## End

Thanks for getting it, I was sure it would be the drawers.
Can you come and get it to me?

## Prompts

- Did you find it?
- Are you still there?
- What can you see there?
- Is everything ok?
